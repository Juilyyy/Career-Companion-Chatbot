🎯 Project Purpose

This chatbot is part of my personal portfolio and was originally built as an academic assignment using IBM Watson Assistant. But it’s evolved into something much cooler: a conversational layer for discovering my work, skills, and hobbies — without clicking through a dozen tabs.

Answers at least 5 questions about my skills, experience, and interests

“Help” feature to guide you on what to ask

Feedback option so you can rate responses (no hard feelings)

Embedded cleanly via Watson Assistant Web Chat

“Tell me about your experience at UTHealth.”

“What kind of data projects have you worked on?”

“Can you summarize your skillset?”

“How do I interact with this chatbot?”
